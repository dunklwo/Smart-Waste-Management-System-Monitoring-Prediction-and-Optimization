 Smart Waste Management System (Learning-Oriented ML Project)

 Overview
This project is a learning-focused Smart Waste Management System developed to understand and apply machine learning models in a real-world inspired use case. The system combines data analytics, image classification, and predictive modeling to explore how ML techniques can be trained, evaluated, and integrated into an application.

 Key Learning Objectives
- Train and evaluate machine learning models on structured data
- Build and deploy an image-based waste classification model
- Understand model comparison, performance metrics, and confidence scores
- Integrate ML models into a Streamlit-based web application
- Work with databases and real-time dashboards

Core Features
- Image-Based Waste Classifier 
  Classifies uploaded waste images into categories with confidence levels using a trained deep learning model.
- ML Model Comparison 
  Compares multiple machine learning models on waste fill-level data.
- Analytics Dashboard
  Visualizes bin status, trends, and alerts.
- Complaint Management  
  Stores and tracks citizen complaints using a database.
- Route Planning (Heuristic-Based)
  Demonstrates basic route prioritization logic for waste collection.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
